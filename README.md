## Shell Scripts

This section contains various shell scripts I've written for different tasks.

### Script 1: `add_numbers.sh`

*   **Description:** This script takes two numbers as input from the user and calculates their sum.
*   **Usage:** To run the script, use the following command:
    ```bash
    ./add_numbers.sh
    ```
*   **Example:**
    ```
    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 20
    The sum of 10 and 20 is: 30
    ```

### Script 2: `file_checker.sh`

*   **Description:** This script checks for the existence of `.txt` and `.c` files in the current directory. If none are found, it creates dummy files.  It then lists all `.txt` and `.c` files present.
*   **Usage:** To run the script, use the following command:
    ```bash
    ./file_checker.sh
    ```
*   **Example:**

    **Scenario 1: No .txt or .c files exist:**
    ```
    No .txt or .c files found. Creating dummy files...
    Dummy .txt and .c files created.
    Listing all .txt and .c files:
    dummy1.c  dummy2.c  dummy1.txt  dummy2.txt
    ```

    **Scenario 2: Some .txt and .c files exist:**
    ```
    .txt and .c files found in the directory.
    Listing all .txt and .c files:
    existing_file.txt  another_file.c  ... (other files)
    ```
*   **Screenshot:** (Optional) Add a screenshot here.

**Note:**  Replace the placeholder descriptions and examples with the actual details of your assignments.  This template provides a good starting point for your README file.  Remember to keep it concise and easy to read.  **To add screenshots:**

1.  Create an `images` folder (or any folder you prefer) in the root of your repository.
2.  Save your screenshots in this folder.  Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `add_numbers_screenshot.png`).
3.  In the README, use the Markdown image syntax: `![Alt Text](path/to/screenshot.png)`.  The "Alt Text" is a brief description of the image (good for accessibility).  The `path/to/screenshot.png` should be the relative path from the README file to the image (e.g., `images/add_numbers_screenshot.png`).
